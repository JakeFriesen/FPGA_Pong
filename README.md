# Pong on Basys3 FPGA

*Jake Friesen*

<p>This Project is a simple start to test out the Basys3 FPGA. Pong is a very simple test to process object motion and display it on a VGA display. The seven-segment display is used to display the score. VGA driver VHDL is adapted from code used at the University of Victoria ECE 441 Lab Section.</p>
